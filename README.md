# exercise
The initial version of the Readme is aimed at **practicing** some Markdown syntax and *formatting*.
>Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs.
>
Lists can be:
- ordered
- unordered
To create an unordered list, add any of these in front of line items:
- dashes (-)
* asterisks (*)
+ or plus signs (+)

- To create a nested list: 
  - Indent one
  - or more items

To include a link, use [square brackets] for the link text and (round brackets) for the URL. To learn more about Markdown syntax, use [this site](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
